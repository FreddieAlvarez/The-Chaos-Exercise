# TaskFlow - Team Task Management System

## Chaos Exercise Starter Code

This repository contains the starter code for the **Chaos Exercise** assignment from COMPS XI - Software Development.

### What is this?

This is a partially built task management application. You'll be attempting to add features to this application **without any planning or methodology** to experience firsthand why the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is essential.

### Your Mission

You have **1 hour** to implement the features requested by the client (see assignment instructions). You are **prohibited from planning** - just start coding and see what happens.

### What's Included

This starter repository contains:

- `index.html` - Basic HTML structure with Bootstrap integration
- `styles.css` - Minimal styling that overrides Bootstrap defaults
- `script.js` - A simple `renderTasks()` function and sample task data structure

### Client Requirements

Read the client's email in your assignment instructions for the vague, ambiguous requirements you need to implement.

### Rules

❌ Do NOT write down requirements  
❌ Do NOT create a plan or design  
❌ Do NOT sketch wireframes  
❌ Do NOT discuss your approach with anyone  
❌ Do NOT research best practices first  

✅ DO just start coding immediately  
✅ DO stop after 1 hour, even if you're not done  
✅ DO push your code to GitHub, even if it's broken  

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Set a 1-hour timer
4. Start coding!

### After the Chaos

Once your hour is up, you'll write a reflection analyzing what went wrong and learn how SDLC phases could have prevented the problems you encountered.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla - no frameworks)
- Bootstrap 5.3.0 (via CDN)

**Note**: Your code is supposed to be messy and incomplete. That's the learning opportunity to see why the SDLC is utilized by software teams
